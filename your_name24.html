        <h2>About This Map</h2>
        <p>My map is based in Staten Island, New York. I have resided here all my life and know the area very well. Each place that is on my map holds meaning to my life in different ways. Starting with my daytime walk, the first place on my map is the FDNY Engine 165 Ladder 85 firehouse. I start my daytime walk here and I have been doing so for a while now. I think it is awesome to start my walk here as passing a firehouse really makes you appreciate our firefighters as they are first responders who risk their lives for other people. The next place on my map is Walker Pond. While Walker Pond may not be that popular or known, it is still such a nice pond that I always pass by. It is extremely peaceful and quiet; in the summer it is nice to read a book by this pond. High Rock Park is another place that is important to my life. Many people are unaware of it, but it is a nice hiking trail. I have many memories of High Rock Park as my high school was in the area. I belonged to sports teams in high school, and when the weather was nice; me and my basketball teammates would go running at High Rock Park to improve our conditioning. I usually end my daytime walk around a small shopping plaza. The next place on my map is a store called Amazing Games TCG. They have a lot of call stuff in there if you are interested in things like Pokémon Cards. My nighttime walk is not far from my daytime walk, it normally starts at the Grant City Train station. I used to take this exact train every single day throughout my four years of high school. Whenever I walk at nighttime, I usually stop for dinner. One restaurant that I frequent is called Teriyaki One. I enjoy their sushi rolls! My favorite one is the “dynamite” roll. The next place on my map is ShopRite. This is my local and go-to grocery store, I will normally pick up some items every time I stop by. This location is only a few years old. The old one was a few blocks away, my family used to go grocery shopping there every single week. I personally think the newer one is better, as it is way more upgraded, they even have a pizzeria an inside of it. The next place on my map is the New Dorp train station. I usually end my nighttime walk here. Sometimes I will walk and other times I take the train back home, normally depending on the weather. The last place on my map is La Strada Italian restaurant. I added this to my map when I first created my Leaflet map. It is my all-time favorite restaurant. Me and my family have been eating there for around ten years, we have also had many parties/events here! I enjoy their pasta dishes.
        <p>After taking this course, I can say that I have learned a good amount about GIS. For example, it is interesting to know that basically every map that I view online uses GIS. Learning how to use QGIS is valuable to me. I really enjoy making maps from and also furthering my knowledge on coding. It will be very interesting to use my knowledge of GIS that I learned by taking this course and applying it to future use. For example, if I continue to live in Staten Island, GIS will be useful to map out how it has changed since this current time.
